<h1> Metro-Fire Safety Project <h1>
<p> A digitalization effort to improve efficiency of the Metro-Fire Safety Team </p>

<h2> What are we doing? </h2>
<p> We are making an app to streamline the tedious process of filling out the form that Metro-Fire Safety employees have to fill out in order to conduct safety checks of various buildings in the city. </p>

<h3> That's 120 slots on the grid to fill </h3>
    
<p> By simply automating the top row on the grid, which is 12 boxes. Assuming that each box on the grid takes the same amount of time to fill out, and lets take the arbitrary 1 second as a number. That's 12 seconds per form, if the average worker fills out 1 form a day for every working day ( The USA has roughly 259 ~ 260 working days in a year) that is a total of 3108 seconds or almost 52 minutes worth of time saved! </p>
  
<p> Now 52 minutes doesn't look like much in a year, but that's assuming we can only automate the time portion of the grid and 1 person doing 1 form a day! Now, think of the time the Metro-Fire Safety Team can save if we automate 2 grids, people doing an average of 1.5 forms a day, and taking an average of 1.5 seconds to fill out each grid. That 51.8 minutes skyrockets to 233.1 minutes of time saved! </p>
  
<p> Another advantage of our app would be the digitalization of the database! Many organizations still stick to paper or are stuck with paper based documentation. Which can be lost, misplaced, or even ink fading over time. Our app should provide a proof of concept that could demonstrate how much faster, easier, and more efficiently we can do things with the power of technology! </p?
